**⚠️ Toko is currently in highly development mode, so I DO NOT recommend using it for production mode since it will change over the following weeks.**

## Jamstack e-commerce solution

Toko is an **Open Source Jamstack e-commerce** solution powered by NuxtJS (Front-End) and Directus (CMS). Toko focuses on four key points: **Performances** to give users fast loading time, **low data consumption** to improve the eco-conception, **SEO-friendly** content, and **modern design** templates.

## Free and Open Source

Toko is also mainly **free to use**, thanks to the Jamstack. You can deploy your front-end to Netlify and the CMS to Heroku for free. The only expense you'll need is probably a domain name ($10 / year), but this is optional.

## Focus on content creation

Toko is **perfect for people looking to focus on content creation** and not technical and performance optimization. Once everything is deployed, set up, and customized, you can start selling right away!
